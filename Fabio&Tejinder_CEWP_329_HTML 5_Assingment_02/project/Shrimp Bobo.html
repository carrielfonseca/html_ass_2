        <h3>Health Tip of the Day</h3>
        <h4>Make Time for Breakfast</h4>
       
            Even though breakfast has been associated with positive effects on metabolism, weight, and nutrient intake, a study of US breakfast habits showed that 1 in 5 Americans skip breakfast. Here are some tips to squeeze in this important meal.
        <img src = "images/breakfast.png" alt ="breakfast picture" title ="breakfast picture" width="100" height="100" class= "center"/>
            <ul>
              <li>Do you have good intentions of eating breakfast more often, but continually find yourself rushing out the door without it? Set your alarm clock 10 minutes earlier.</li>
              <li>Prepare for breakfast the night before—set out dishes, utensils, and shelf-stable food on the counter.</li>
              <li>Stock the kitchen with “grab and go” items such as yogurt, fruit, granola bars, trail mix, and string cheese.</li>
              <li>Eat breakfast when you first get up to be sure you don’t miss it.</li>
            </ul>
