         <h2> The Table Comes First: Family, France, and the Meaning of Food </h2>
        
         
           <p>  &ldquo;I DON'T understand how a young couple can begin life by buying a sofa or a television,&rdquo; Fergus Henderson, a fashionable London chef, once told the author. &ldquo;Don't they know the table comes first?&rdquo; Adam Gopnik borrows the phrase as the title of his new book, an expanded collection of his food writing for the New Yorker over the past 25 years. Our lives these days are best measured in meals, he argues, eaten in or out: &ldquo;we are courted, spurned, recruited, hired, fired, lured to a new job, or released from an old one&rdquo; over the lunch or dinner table. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Mr Gopnik's range is ambitious. He revisits the birthplace of the modern restaurant in revolutionary Paris, when menus, waiters and food critics first emerged. A 1789 decree allowed wine and coffee to be served on the same premises. By 1805 there were 15 restaurants and 20 cafés under the arcades of the Palais Royal alone, a place of &ldquo;mad gaiety&rdquo;, in Balzac's words. Mr Gopnik's musings reach from the insularity of contemporary French gastronomy to the changing moral fashions that dictate what we eat. Meat, or no meat? The whole carcass, innards included (as Mr Henderson serves it)? Or just the familiar bits for squeamish diners raised on cellophane-wrapped protein?
       </p>

        <p>
           He considers the &ldquo;localism&rdquo; movement, which urges consumers to stick to indigenous produce and shun green beans flown in from Kenya or tomatoes from Spain. At one point Mr Gopnik tries to spend a week cooking with ingredients sourced in the New York City area. He finds peppers from Staten Island, arugula in Brooklyn, even honey made by Manhattan bees. But his plans to serve a locally raised chicken are comically foiled at the last turn. The Bronx farmer he has tracked down assumes that Mr Gopnik wants to buy the bird to raise it; he is not amused to learn that the author wants it dead.
       </p>
        <p>
           Some of Mr Gopnik's insights are particularly well judged. He is right that the codified culture of French cooking—&ldquo;a lump of protein sautéed in a pan, the pan cleansed by a liquid, the liquid reduced to a sauce&rdquo;—has inhibited innovation. Why, he asks, is there no haute cuisine based on north African spices?
        </p>
        <p>
           As a collection, this book is inevitably a bit disjointed. Despite the subtitle, it is not really about family life, nor about the French. It is above all about Mr Gopnik and his passionate, under-the-fingernails love of food. This is a man who describes reading cookery books in bed, and confesses to spending his teenage years poring over recipes. He seems never happier than when slicing, chopping or sautéing, preparing a fillet of beef with béarnaise sauce or a tarte tatin. &ldquo;The act of cooking is an escape from consciousness,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;the nearest thing that the nonspiritual modern man and woman have to Zen meditation.&rdquo; Like a béchamel sauce, the resulting book is sometimes smooth, but occasionally lumpy. In short, an uneven feast flavoured with tasty morsels. Bon appétit.

        <h3>Health Tip of the Day</h3>
        <h4>Make Time for Breakfast</h4>
       
            Even though breakfast has been associated with positive effects on metabolism, weight, and nutrient intake, a study of US breakfast habits showed that 1 in 5 Americans skip breakfast. Here are some tips to squeeze in this important meal.
        <img src = "images/breakfast.png" alt ="breakfast picture" title ="breakfast picture" width="100" height="100" class= "center"/>
            <ul>
              <li>Do you have good intentions of eating breakfast more often, but continually find yourself rushing out the door without it? Set your alarm clock 10 minutes earlier.</li>
              <li>Prepare for breakfast the night before—set out dishes, utensils, and shelf-stable food on the counter.</li>
              <li>Stock the kitchen with “grab and go” items such as yogurt, fruit, granola bars, trail mix, and string cheese.</li>
              <li>Eat breakfast when you first get up to be sure you don’t miss it.</li>
