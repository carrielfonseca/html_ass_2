        <h4>Our Cooking Manifesto</h4>
        <p>
            
We love spending time in the kitchen, and we believe that memorable cooking doesn't have to be complicated or precious. It's about discovering that frying an egg in olive oil over high heat gives the white a great crackly texture, that slashing the legs of a chicken before roasting allows the dark and white meat to cook evenly, that maple syrup adds not only sweetness but depth to an otherwise ho-hum vinaigrette.
        </p>
        <p>
            
Most cooking sites and blogs take a top-down approach, telling you what to cook and failing to give you a sense of the people and creative process behind the recipes. We don't want to be yet another site that insists on dumbing down recipes to make them "quick" and "easy" — so we won't.
        </p>
        <p>Because:</p>
        <ul>
             <li> If you cook, your family will eat dinner together.</li>
              <li>If you cook, you will naturally have a more sustainable household.</li>
              <li>If you cook, you'll set a lifelong example for your children.</li>
              <li>If you cook, you'll understand what goes into food and will eat more healthily.</li>
              <li>If you cook, you'll make your home an important place in your life.</li>
              <li>If you cook, you'll make others happy.</li>
              <li>If you cook, people will remember you.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Health Tip of the Day</h3>
        <h4>Make Time for Breakfast</h4>
       
            Even though breakfast has been associated with positive effects on metabolism, weight, and nutrient intake, a study of US breakfast habits showed that 1 in 5 Americans skip breakfast. Here are some tips to squeeze in this important meal.
        <img src = "images/breakfast.png" alt ="breakfast picture" title ="breakfast picture" width="100" height="100" class= "center"/>
            <ul>
              <li>Do you have good intentions of eating breakfast more often, but continually find yourself rushing out the door without it? Set your alarm clock 10 minutes earlier.</li>
              <li>Prepare for breakfast the night before—set out dishes, utensils, and shelf-stable food on the counter.</li>
              <li>Stock the kitchen with “grab and go” items such as yogurt, fruit, granola bars, trail mix, and string cheese.</li>
              <li>Eat breakfast when you first get up to be sure you don’t miss it.</li>
