         <h2> Food Revolution Day: exclusive interview with Jamie Oliver" </h2>

           <p class = "question">  What is Food Revolution Day and what drove you to start it?  </p>
        <p>
           Well, I've been truly humbled and amazed by all the incredible things happening all around the world. It seems like every five minutes I'm hearing about another great event in countries like Dubai, Turkey, Slovakia, Brazil, and of course Australia, France, the UK and the US.  There's even a couple having a food revolution wedding, which is fantastic!  I can't possibly choose one, so I'll just say a huge thank you to everyone hosting an event or a dinner - however small it may seem - it all makes a difference.
       </p>
       <p class = "question"> In an ideal world, what would Food Revolution Day achieve?   </p>
        <p>
           In an ideal world we wouldn't have Food Revolution Day because we wouldn't need to, but where food's concerned we've been making the wrong choices for so long, that we need to find a way to get ourselves back on track.  I'm really hoping that Food Revolution Day will focus as many people as possible on the problems we face, as well as the potential solutions and steps we can take to get things moving in the right direction. It's important that these changes happen on a personal, as well as government level, for things to move forward and for everyone to live healthier, happier lives.  
        </p>
       <p class = "question"> How can BYC members and young people get involved in Food Revolution Day?  </p>
        <p>
           You could host a little dinner party for your family and friends, using fresh ingredients to cook up something really amazing - there are plenty of recipes on the food rev website if you're after a bit of inspiration, or just use one of your own. And, don't forget to tell us about it. Another option, if you're a competent cook, is to hold a little cooking class for any friends who can't cook. Or, have a look on the site and see if there's a food rev event near you and either volunteer to help or pop along to show your support.
        </p>
        <p class = "question"> The Government paid a lot of attention to your TV series Jamie's School Dinners and the subsequent Feed Me Better campaign in 2005 - what changed as a result? </p>
        <p> Initially, school food got better because of the nutritional standards that were brought in, and then slowly over the next few years, more and more children and young people voted with their feet and decided that yes, this is the sort of food they wanted to eat. I've always said that young people are very, very smart and that if you give them just a little bit of information, they'll totally take it to heart and run with it. It's such an incredible thing to witness, and exactly what this campaign is all about. The current government is taking less care with our health and is set to undermine the positive changes that have been made over the last seven years.

        <h3>Health Tip of the Day</h3>
        <h4>Make Time for Breakfast</h4>
       
            Even though breakfast has been associated with positive effects on metabolism, weight, and nutrient intake, a study of US breakfast habits showed that 1 in 5 Americans skip breakfast. Here are some tips to squeeze in this important meal.
        <img src = "images/breakfast.png" alt ="breakfast picture" title ="breakfast picture" width="100" height="100" class= "center"/>
            <ul>
              <li>Do you have good intentions of eating breakfast more often, but continually find yourself rushing out the door without it? Set your alarm clock 10 minutes earlier.</li>
              <li>Prepare for breakfast the night before—set out dishes, utensils, and shelf-stable food on the counter.</li>
              <li>Stock the kitchen with “grab and go” items such as yogurt, fruit, granola bars, trail mix, and string cheese.</li>
              <li>Eat breakfast when you first get up to be sure you don’t miss it.</li>
            </ul>
